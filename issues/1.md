## AutoClipperApp Fix Roadmap (v2.3)
- [x] 1. Output folder path fixed to `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Videos\AutoClipperApp`
  - "View Output Folder" always opens that path
- [x] 2. yt-dlp download errors (403/fragment) handled with format fallback
- [x] 3. Playlist load failures blocked until valid, with clear GUI error
- [x] 4. Right-click context menus (Cut/Copy/Paste) added to all text fields
- [x] 5. Visible clipboard buttons wired up and styled to match the UI
- [x] 6. Skipped videos (private, age or region-blocked) are logged and do not interrupt
- [x] 7. `log.txt` generated in output folder after each session
- [x] 8. End-to-end confirmation that yt-dlp and ffmpeg work, with GUI logs on failure
- [x] 9. Chrome cookie extraction fixed or user-guided export flow added
- [x] 10. Authentication requirements explained clearly when playlist needs login

All roadmap tasks implemented.
