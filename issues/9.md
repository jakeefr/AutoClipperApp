## AutoClipperApp Fix Roadmap (v2.4)
- [x] 1. Remove all `--cookies` and `--cookies-from-browser` usage from the entire app
- [x] 2. Do not attempt to access browser data or extract Chrome/Edge profiles
- [x] 3. If a video or playlist requires login (e.g., private, age-restricted, region-blocked), skip it silently
  - Log: `Skipped: Requires login (private, age-restricted, or unavailable)`
  - Maintain a counter for skipped videos
- [x] 4. Do not raise popups or GUI alerts for login-related failures
- [x] 5. Continue downloading remaining public videos normally without interruption
- [x] 6. Never mention login, cookies, or browser access anywhere in the app or GUI
- [x] 7. Confirm no `yt-dlp` errors about browser cookies ever appear again in the log
- [x] 8. Display number of skipped videos in final log summary

Internet connection is required to download public videos.
No login, authentication, cookies, or browser integration is required â€” and must never be triggered.
**Codex must check off each task above as it completes them.**

All roadmap tasks implemented.
