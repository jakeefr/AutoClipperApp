## AutoClipperApp Bugfix Tasks (Post-Roadmap v2.4)
- [x] 1. GUI freezes during download or clip process (`Not Responding`)
  - Move all long-running processes (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, file operations) to background threads using `threading.Thread(...)`
  - Ensure the GUI remains responsive while downloads/clips are running
  - Re-enable buttons and update progress/log after thread completes
- [x] 2. EXE crashes on launch: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'customtkinter'`
  - Ensure `customtkinter` is included in PyInstaller build:
    - Add to `requirements.txt` if missing: `customtkinter`
    - Update `.spec` file or use `--hidden-import customtkinter` if needed
  - Rebuild `.exe` and verify it works without Python installed
- [x] 3. Bundle yt-dlp and ffmpeg binaries in `/bin` or download them on first run
  - Include binaries in the PyInstaller build
  - Download to `/bin` when missing with clear progress messages
- [x] 4. Handle download failures gracefully with a helpful error
- [x] 5. Confirm the packaged EXE launches offline without Python
